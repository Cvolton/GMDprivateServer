## Geometry Dash Private Server
Basically a Geometry Dash Server Emulator

Supported version of Geometry Dash: 1.0 - 2.11

(See [the backwards compatibility section of this article](https://github.com/Cvolton/GMDprivateServer/wiki/Deliberate-differences-from-real-GD) for more information)

Required version of PHP: 5.5+ (tested up to 8.1.2)

### Branches
- master - This is the main version of the server.
- untested - This branch contains the newest breaking changes. Note that this branch has virtually no support and therefore you're on your own if stuff breaks.

### Setup
1) Upload the files on a webserver
2) Import database.sql into a MySQL/MariaDB database
3) Edit the links in GeometryDash.exe (some are base64 encoded since 2.1, remember that)

#### Updating the server
See [README.md in the `_updates`](_updates/README.md)
