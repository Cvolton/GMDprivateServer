# Contributing... #

First of all, thanks for helping us to develop and fixing GDPS. This is guideline to how to contribute to this project.

## Rules Of Contribute ##
We aren't monsters, so we haven't heavy rules, just these simple rules:

### Your Contribute is need be an actual Contribute. ###
Changing some numbers, editing some texts isn't a contribution. You need contribute that doesn't exist, bug-fix etc.

### Test Your Contribution before submit. ###
If you can, please test your code works. If you can't, please just leave *NEEDS TESTING* tag, so another person can test and sends results to your request.

### Submiting Your Contributions ###
If your code is adds something new or fixing a bug, you can request Pull Request to review and adding to actual code.  
  
Thanks for reading this file. We are waiting your ideas ;)
